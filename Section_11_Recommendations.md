### Quick wins with measurable impact

---

### 1️⃣ DISCOUNT POLICY REFORM
**Current State:**
- Orders with 60%+ discounts generate net losses
- Average discount: [X]%
- Annual profit leak: $[Y] from excessive discounting

**Root Cause:**
- No approval process for high discounts
- Sales team incentivized on revenue, not profit
- Legacy "deep discount" customer expectations

**Action Plan:**
```
Implement 3-tier discount approval system:
- 0-15%: Automatic approval
- 16-30%: Manager approval required
- 30%+: VP approval + written business case
```

**Expected Impact:**
- Reduce average discount from [X]% to 25%
- Recoverable profit: $[Y] annually
- Payback period: Immediate (policy change only)

**Owner:** VP Sales + Pricing Team  
**Deadline:** February 15, 2026  
**Investment:** $0 (policy change)  
**ROI:** ∞% (pure profit recovery)

**Success Metrics:**
- Average discount ≤ 25% by March 1
- Zero orders >60% discount after Feb 15
- Gross margin improvement: +[Z] percentage points

**Risks & Mitigation:**
- Risk: Customer pushback from frequent discount users
- Mitigation: Grandfather existing contracts, implement gradually
- Risk: Revenue dip in short term
- Mitigation: Focus on volume growth at healthier margins

---

### 2️⃣ AT-RISK CUSTOMER WIN-BACK CAMPAIGN
**Current State:**
- [X]% of high-value customers in "At Risk" RFM segment
- Combined CLV of at-risk segment: $[Y]
- Average days since last purchase: [Z] (above churn threshold)

**Root Cause:**
- No automated retention system
- Competitor offers better loyalty programs
- Poor post-purchase engagement

**Action Plan:**
```
Phase 1 (Days 1-7):
- Identify all customers with Recency > 90 days + CLV > $500
- Create personalized email list (no generic blasts)
- Design 3-touch campaign:
  - Touch 1: "We miss you" + 20% discount
  - Touch 2: New product showcase
  - Touch 3: Personal call from account manager (top 20)

Phase 2 (Days 8-30):
- Monitor response rates
- A/B test offer levels (15% vs 20% vs free shipping)
- Capture win-back reasons (survey)
```

**Expected Impact:**
- Reactivation rate: 10-15% (industry benchmark)
- Recovered customers: [X × 12.5%] = [Y] customers
- Revenue recovery: [Y] customers × $[avg CLV] = $[Z]
- Campaign cost: $[A] (email + discounts + labor)
- Net profit: $[Z - A]

**Owner:** CRM Manager  
**Deadline:** Campaign live February 1, 2026  
**Investment:** $[A] (one-time)  
**ROI:** [Z/A]× = [result]%

Example:
1. Tables (Furniture): -$8,000 annual loss
2. Bookcases: -$6,200 annual loss
3. Supplies (low-margin): -$4,500 annual loss
```

**Root Cause:**
- Pricing below cost (legacy contracts)
- High shipping costs not factored into price
- Low-volume SKUs with high overhead

**Action Plan:**
```
Phase 1 (Week 1-2): Analysis
- Confirm which SKUs are truly unprofitable (not loss leaders)
- Calculate replacement cost if customers leave
- Identify alternative products to recommend

Phase 2 (Week 3-4): Execution
- Raise prices 15-25% on marginally profitable items
- Discontinue items with <5 orders/month AND negative margin
- Notify affected customers with alternatives
- Clear remaining inventory at cost

Phase 3 (Month 2): Monitor
- Track customer churn from discontinued products
- Measure margin improvement
- Calculate actual vs projected impact
```

**Expected Impact:**
- Eliminate $[Y] annual loss immediately
- Free up $[Z] in working capital (inventory)
- Reduce SKU complexity by [X]%
- Minimal revenue loss (<2% of customers affected)

**Owner:** Product Manager + Finance
